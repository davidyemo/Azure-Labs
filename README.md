üåê Azure Administrator Associate AZ-104 Labs

This repository contains my completed hands on labs from the Microsoft AZ-104: Azure Administrator Associate course. Each lab demonstrates key Azure administration skills including deploying infrastructure with templates, configuring Recovery Services vaults, managing backups, monitoring resources, creating alerts, and using Azure Monitor log queries.

The goal of this repo is to showcase practical experience in Azure infrastructure management, backup and disaster recovery, monitoring, and automation, reflecting real-world cloud administration tasks and best practices.
