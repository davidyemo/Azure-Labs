Lab_9c Implement Azure Container Apps

Task 1: Create and Configure an Azure Container App and Environment

An Azure Container App named `my-app` was created in the East US region under the resource group `az104-rg9`. A new Container Apps Environment named `my-environment` was also created. The deployment used the quickstart image “Simple hello world container” to initialize the app. After configuration, the app was reviewed and deployed successfully in the Azure portal.

Task 2: Test and Verify Deployment of the Azure Container App
Once deployment completed, the container app was accessed via the provided Application URL. The application displayed the default “Your Azure Container Apps app is live” message, confirming successful deployment.

Outcome
The Azure Container App and its environment were successfully created and verified. The application is running and reachable through its public DNS endpoint, demonstrating a functional and scalable containerized deployment using Azure Container Apps.
